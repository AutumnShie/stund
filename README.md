# stund
Stund download from https://sourceforge.net/projects/stun/files/stun/0.97/

In openwrt menuconfig, you only need to select stun-client

The patched easycwmp https://github.com/AutumnShie/easycwmp can support TR-111 with this stun client

We have verified the TR-111 scenario with Axiros Axess ACS
